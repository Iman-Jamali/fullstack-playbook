# Fullstack Playbook

Welcome to the Fullstack Playbook! This repository is designed to share essential knowledge and best practices for building full stack applications. The repository consists of two main components: **demo apps** and **guides**.

The **demo app** is a collection of simple web application showcasing important aspects of full stack development. Currently there is only one app, Todo-app that allows users to create and manage their todo items. More will be added in the future.

The **guides** section covers critical topics for successful full stack applications, such as deployment, CI/CD, and databases. These guides serve as valuable references for everyday full stack development tasks.

This project is a work in progress, contributions are encouraged from the community. Please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to help improve the Fullstack Playbook.

I'm a software developer with a passion for all things full stack, and I'm currently working at [EY Design Studio](https://studio.ey.com/en_ca/).
