## Crowdsource

The Crowdsource App is a web3 application that allows users to create a campaign to raise funds for a cause. The campaign creator can create a campaign and set a minimum contribution amount. Contributors can contribute to the campaign, and the campaign creator can create spending requests to utilize the raised funds. Contributors can vote on the spending requests. If a spending request receives more than 50% of the votes, the campaign creator can finalize it, and the funds will be transferred to the intended recipient. This app demonstrates the integration of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized decision-making in crowdfunding scenarios.
